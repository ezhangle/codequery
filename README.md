![CodeQuery](doc/logotitle.png)
===============================

This is a tool to index, then query or search C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby and Go source code.

It builds upon the databases of [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) and [Exuberant ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).

The databases of *cscope* and *ctags* would be processed by the *cqmakedb* tool to generate the CodeQuery database file.

The CodeQuery database file can be viewed and queried using the *codequery* GUI tool.

## Latest version = v0.15

Windows and Linux binaries available here for download: [CodeQuery@sourceforge downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codequery/files/)

To build on Linux, please read the [INSTALL-LINUX](doc/INSTALL-LINUX.md) file. The latest git version (HEAD on master branch) can be used.

Please read [NEWS](NEWS.txt) to find out more.


## How is it different from cscope and ctags? What are the advantages?

Both cscope and ctags can do symbol lookup and identify functions, macros, classes and structs.

cscope is very C-centric, but is fuzzy enough to cover C++ and Java, but not very well for e.g. it doesn't understand destructors and class member instantiations. It can't provide relationships of class inheritance and membership. cscope can do "functions that call this function" and "functions called by this function". This is a very powerful feature that makes cscope stand out among comparable tools.

ctags does many languages well and understands destructors, member instantiations, and the relationships of class membership and inheritance. From ctags, we can find out "members and methods of this class", "class which owns this member or method", "parent of this class", "child of this class" etc. However, it doesn't do "functions that call this function" or "functions called by this function".

So both these tools have their pros and cons, but complement each other.

CodeQuery is a project that attempts to combine the features available from both cscope and ctags, provide faster database access compared to cscope (because it uses sqlite) and provides a nice GUI tool as well. Due to this faster database access, fast auto-completion of search terms and multiple complex queries to perform visualization is possible.

In addition, [pycscope](https://github.com/portante/pycscope) is used to add support for Python, in place of cscope.

In addition, [starscope](https://github.com/eapache/starscope) is used to add support for Ruby and Go, in place of cscope.


## What features does CodeQuery have?

* Combines the best of both cscope and ctags
* Faster due to the use of sqlite for the CodeQuery database
* Cross-platform GUI tool
* Fast auto-completion of search term
* Case-insensitive, partial keyword search - wildcard search supported * and ?
* Exact match search
* Filter search results by file path
* File viewer with syntax highlighting
* Ability to open viewed file in an external editor or IDE
* Visualization of function call graph and class inheritance based on search term
* Visualization graphs can be saved to PNG or Graphviz DOT files


## What types of query can I make?

* Symbol
* Function or macro definition
* Class or struct
* Functions calling this function
* Functions called by this function
* Calls of this function or macro
* Class which owns this member or method
* Members and methods of this class
* Parent of this class (inheritance)
* Children of this class (inheritance)
* Files including this file
* Full path for file
* Functions and macros inside this file
* Grep


## What does it look like?

## How does the visualization look like?

Here's a function call graph based on the search term of "updateFilePathLabel". A -> B means A calls B:

## What does it cost? How is it licensed?

It's freeware and free open source software.

This software is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) or [LICENSE.txt](windows-install/LICENSE.txt).

Files under the `querylib` directory are licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See [QueryLib README](querylib/README.txt). This is a library to query CodeQuery database files. This library is MIT-licensed, so that it may be used to create plugins for editors, IDEs and other software without license restrictions. It's only dependency is on sqlite3.


## Can I use it in a commercial environment without purchasing, for an unlimited time?

Yes. However, donations are welcomed.


## Which platforms are supported?

It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit, Windows XP, Mac OS X, Ubuntu and Fedora Linux 64-bit and, Ubuntu and Fedora Linux 32-bit.

Contributions are welcomed to attempt ports to other operating systems.


## Is the software available in other languages?

Yes. This applies only to the GUI tool.

Contributions are welcomed to update or provide new translations.


## How to install it?

On Windows, EXE setup packages will be provided here: [CodeQuery@sourceforge downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codequery/files/). The EXE setup package shall also contain cscope.exe, ctags.exe and the required DLLs. So, everything you need is in one package. However, [pycscope](https://github.com/portante/pycscope) (optional - only for Python) and [starscope](https://github.com/eapache/starscope) (optional - only for Ruby and Go) are not bundled together with this setup package and need to be installed separately.

On Linux, tar.gz, RPM and Debian package installations will be provided here: [CodeQuery@sourceforge downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codequery/files/).

On Mac, the software can be installed through [Brew](http://brew.sh/) using `brew install codequery`.

To build on Linux and Mac, please read the [INSTALL-LINUX](doc/INSTALL-LINUX.md) file.

Version 15.8a of [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) or higher, works best with CodeQuery.


## How do I use it?

On Windows: [HOWTO-WINDOWS](windows-install/HOWTO-WINDOWS.txt). This file is included in the EXE setup package.

On Linux and Mac: [HOWTO-LINUX](doc/HOWTO-LINUX.md)

Please read the HOWTO file provided for each platform. The workflow looks like this:
![CodeQuery workflow](doc/workflow.png)


## Are there any known limitations?

For C and C++, [inline assembly code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_assembler) is not supported by all the tools. This mainly affects embedded software, OS and driver code.

Please exclude files with inline assembly code from the list of files (cscope.files) to be scanned.


## How can I be notified of new version releases?

Follow us on [our FreeCode page](https://freecode.com/projects/codequery) and you should receive emails notifying you of new version releases.
